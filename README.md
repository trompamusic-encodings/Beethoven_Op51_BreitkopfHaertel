# DRAFT encoding template

This repository contains an [MEI](https://music-encoding.org) encoding of the [Two Rondos (Opus 51 No.1 and Opus 51 No.2) by Ludwig van Beethoven, Breitkopf und Härtel edition, 1862–90. Plates B.185 and B.186.](https://imslp.org/wiki/Special:ReverseLookup/518271) 

**Note: The MEI headers still need to be FRBRized. **

We hope that this repository will eventually serve as an encoding template for wider use within the [TROMPA](https://trompamusic.eu) project. For now, no assurances are made regarding the validity or consistency of this encoding or its structure.
